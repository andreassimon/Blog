JAX Conference Take-Aways
=========================

In-Sourcing of Software Development
-----------------------------------

Within 6 months
2 internal, 2 external developers
process: Scrum

Fixed price contracts kill software quality

developer time is precious.
--> Using SaaS and IaaS offers as much as possible

 * GitHub
   "GitHub is the Facebook for nerds."

 * Jenkins + Artifactory as IaaS

 * Monitoring via New Relic
 * Continuous Search Monitoring via SirApp
 * Log Monitoring: Party Gorilla / GrayLog2
 * Feature tracker: After Agilofant, they use Redmine

Teams prefer a physical task board

SaaS tools help making teams agile faster


Verlernte Agilität: schleichende Fehler in agilen Prozessen
-----------------------------------------------------------

Sebastian Bauer (@litervollmilch)

1. problem: product backlog
 * too many stories
 * no non-functional requirements

 => clean up the backlog
 => communicative stories
 => Don't over-specify, let the team breathe
 => Involve the team
 => Alles abbilden, estimate every item

2. problem: Product Owner
 * empowerment is undermined

 => PO must be available
 => dedicated, full-time
 => the ScrumMaster should stärken den PO over and over again, up (higher mgmt) and down (team) the hierarchy
 => Verindere micro-management, protect self-organization

3. problem: ScrumMaster
 * takes over team tasks, loses his focus on impediments
 * takes over PO tasks
 * disciplinary boss
