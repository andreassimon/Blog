# Provide a Solid Fundament for Your Application: Test Your Infrastructure

## Abstract
The major portion of today's applications is backed by a number of servers providing a number of interconnected services.
The stability of these servers is essential to the success of our products and companies.
How can we assure that the infrastructure lives up to these requirements?

Andreas is going to introduce the concepts of DevOps: describe the configuration of your servers and networks using portable scripts.
This approach provides a reliable and repeatable setup process for your infrastructure.
It becomes easy to create a clone of your production environment to another set of machines or even virtual machines on your development workstation.
You can test your setup considerably earlier before going to production.
You can analyze problems in a nearly perfect copy of the real runtime environment.

After covering the basics, Andreas is going to illustrate the possibilities of test-driving your infrastructure and the relationship to other testing activities as performance or security testing.
