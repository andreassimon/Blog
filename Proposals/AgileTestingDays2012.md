Abstract
--------
Agile testers facilitate the transformation of customer requirements to working software.
Acceptance Test-Driven Development as a basic building block improves this process enormously.
One of the best parts of specification by example is the evolution of a common language from
the existing business terminology, also known as "ubiquitous language".
This "project jargon" makes communication much more effective and eases the interaction between
customers and developers.
But what happens once you nailed down the examples?

The agreed terms should be used throughout all the project artifacts---be it acceptance tests,
documentation, or source code.
But more often than not, the developers derive the executable code
from the specification on their own.

_Domain-Specific Languages_ give you a means to involve the customer in this process.
DSLs are computer programming languages of limited expressiveness focused on a particular domain.
They give customers and developers another, comprehensive perspective on the solution
and establish a double-checking process.
Furthermore, domain-specific languages come in
different flavours.
Besides textual formats, you can employ graphical notations that can make the problem
more "visible".

<!--
    Giving you the freedom of choice of the best possible representation for your problem.
-->

Having the logical aspects separated from the technical implementation allows you to react to
changes in requirements faster.
Your cutomer can easily read (and maybe even write)  the "application code", giving the team
another degree of flexibility in terms of division of work.
Last, but not least, domain-specific languages give your team some technical benefits.

After introducing basic concepts and tools of domain-specific languages,
Andreas gives a practical example of developing an order processing system visually.
The presentation will be closed outlining the

    technical, economical, and _communicational_

pros and cons of using domain-specific languages.


Biography
---------
Andreas holds a diploma degree in Information Systems from the University of MÃ¼nster.
He works as a self-employed tester-programmer, supporting SMB in test automation efforts in an
agile context.
Besides, he explores and promotes innovative ideas as a start-up entrepreneur.

His passion for integrating test-driven and model-driven development techniques in agile projects
stems from his diploma thesis that became published as a conference paper later on.
He is one of the organizers of the recently founded, regional Software Craftsmanship
Communities in Germany.
