Abstract
--------
  --Developing the right product--
Agile testers facilitate the transformation of customer requirements to working software.
Acceptance test-driven development improves the specification process enormously.
But what happens once you nailed down the examples?

One of the best parts of an (executable) specification is the evolution of a common language that is
based on the existing business terminology, also known as "ubiquitous language".
This "project jargon" makes communication much more effective and eases the interaction between
customers and developers.
The agreed terms should be used throughout all the artifacts--be it acceptance tests,
documentation, or source code.
But more often than not, the developers derive the general solution from the specification on their own.
Thus, most of the source code remains hidden from the customer.

Domain-specific languages give you a means to involve the customer in this process.
They allow customers and developers another, comprehensive perspective on the solution.
    Within the source code, logical and technical concerns are mixed.
    From examples to executable code together; double checking, giving the involved people
    another, holistic perspective on the problem

Domain-specific languages come in different flavours.
Besides textual formats, you can develop graphical notations that can making the problem
more "visible".
Separating the logical aspects from the technical implementation allows you to reacts to
changes in requirements faster. The "program code" becomes customer readable (and maybe even
writable), giving you one more degree of flexibility in terms of division of work.

    Extending specifications / acceptance tests with executable graphical elements
    Graphical, executable notations
    Domain-specific languages give your team some technical benefits.
    Implementing changes faster
    customer readable (and maybe even writable) code

After introducing basic concepts and tools of domain-specific languages,
Andreas gives a practical example of visually modeling an order processing system.
The presentation will be closed outlining the technical / economical / social pros and cons
of using domain-specific languages.


Biography
---------
Andreas holds a diploma degree in Information Systems. He works as a self-employed tester-programmer
supporting SMB with test automation efforts in an agile context. Besides, he founded two startup
companies. start-up entrepreneur.

His passion for integrating test-driven and model-driven development techniques in agile projects
stems from his diploma thesis that became published as a conference paper later on.
He is one of the organizers of the recently founded regional Software Craftsmanship
Communities in Germany.

In general we value technical and practical presentations (e.g. supported by demos)
more than theoretical ones
