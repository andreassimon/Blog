Abstract
--------
Learn how to involve your customer not only through acceptance tests, but also through
custom-made programming languages focused on your particular domain.

One of the key points of ATDD is the development of a common "project jargon"
from the existing business terminology.
Based on this vocabulary you can create a simple, small programming language on your own.
Such a _Domain-Specific Language_ enables you to involve your customer not only
by writing examples,
but also by developing parts of the production code together.
Andreas will give you a glimpse of what you can achieve with modern language tools.
