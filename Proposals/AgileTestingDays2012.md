Abstract
--------
Learn how to involve the customer not only through acceptance tests, but also through
custom made programming languages focused on your particular domain.

ATDD facilitates the transformation of customer requirements to working software.
One of the core benefits is the evolution of a common language from
the existing business terminology.
This "project jargon" makes communication much more effective and simplifies the interaction between
customers and developers.
But what happens once you nailed down the examples?

More often than not, the developers derive the production code
from the specification on their own.
_Domain-Specific Languages_ provide the opportunity to involve the customer in this activity.
DSLs give customers and developers another, comprehensive perspective on the solution
and enable a double-checking process.
Furthermore, Domain-Specific Languages come in different flavours.
Besides textual formats, you can employ graphical notations that can make the problem
more "visible".

DSLs allow you to react to
changes in requirements faster;
your cutomer can easily read (and maybe even write) the production code, giving the team
another degree of flexibility in terms of division of work.

After introducing basic concepts and tools of Domain-Specific Languages,
Andreas gives a practical example of visually developing an order processing system.
The presentation will be closed outlining the
pros and cons of using Domain-Specific Languages.


Biography
---------
Andreas holds a diploma degree in Information Systems from the University of Muenster.
He works as a self-employed tester-programmer, supporting SMB in test automation efforts in
agile contexts.
Besides, he explores and promotes innovative ideas as a start-up entrepreneur.

His passion for integrating Test-Driven and Model-Driven Development techniques in agile projects
stems from his research activities that became published as a conference paper earlier this year.
He is one of the organizers of the recently founded, regional Software Craftsmanship
Communities in Germany.
