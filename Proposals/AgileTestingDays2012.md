Abstract
--------
Learn how to involve your customer not only through acceptance tests, but also through
custom-made programming languages focused on your particular domain.

ATDD facilitates the transformation of customer requirements to working software.
One of the core benefits is the evolution of a common language from
the existing business terminology.
This "project jargon" makes communication much more effective and simplifies the interaction between
customers and developers.
But what happens once you nailed down the examples?

More often than not, programmers implement the production code on their own.
_Domain-Specific Languages_ provide the opportunity to involve the whole team in this activity.
Besides textual formats, you can also employ graphical notations that can make the problem
more "visible".
Because you can tailor a language perfectly fitting your business domain,
your customer can easily read (and maybe even write) the production code.
Domain-Specific Languages give customers, testers and programmers another, comprehensive
perspective on
the solution and enable a double-checking process.
By expressing the production code in business terms only, you can pass
through the whole ATDD cycle together with your customer.

After introducing concepts and tools of Domain-Specific Languages,
Andreas gives a practical example of visually developing an order processing system.
