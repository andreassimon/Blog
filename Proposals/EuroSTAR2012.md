Abstract
--------
Learn how to involve your customer not only through acceptance tests, but also through
custom-made, easy programming languages focused on your particular domain.

ATDD facilitates the transformation of customer requirements to working software.
One of the core benefits is the evolution of a common language from
the existing business terminology.
This "project jargon" makes communication much more effective and simplifies the interaction between
customers and developers.
But what happens once you nailed down the examples?

More often than not, programmers implement the production code on their own.
_Domain-Specific Languages_ provide the opportunity to involve the whole team in this activity.
Besides textual formats, you can also employ graphical notations that can make the problem
more "visible".
Because you can tailor a language perfectly fitting your business domain,
your customer can easily read (and maybe even write) the production code.
Domain-Specific Languages give customers, testers and programmers another, comprehensive
perspective on
the solution and enable a double-checking process.
By expressing the production code in business terms only, you can pass
through the whole ATDD cycle together with your customer.

After introducing concepts and tools of Domain-Specific Languages,
Andreas gives a practical example of visually developing an order processing system.

Takeaways
---------
1. Develop a common project language
1. Incorporate the domain language into your production code
1. Build your own programming language as a tool for better team interaction

Speaking Experience
-------------------
Regular speaker at user group events / workshops

As an example of my presentations, I give a link to an introduction to Ruby on Rails:

Supporting Material
-------------------
The idea for this talk stems from a few observations I made during the last Agile Testing Days.
I summed up my impressions in a blog entry:
http://andreas-simon.blogspot.com/2011/11/models-at-agile-testing-days-2011.html

My scientfic paper "Using Spring Roo for the Test-Driven Development od Web Applications" 
will be published during the upcoming ACM Symposium On Applied Computing
(http://oldwww.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2012/) in March.
The paper deals with a specific approach to integrate model-driven development into an agile,
acceptance-test-driven process.


Biography
---------
Andreas holds a diploma degree in Information Systems from the University of Muenster.
He works as a self-employed tester-programmer, supporting SMB in test automation efforts in
agile contexts.
Besides, he explores and promotes innovative ideas as a start-up entrepreneur.

He published a conference paper on integrating Test-Driven and Model-Driven Development techniques
in agile projects earlier this year.
He is one of the organizers of the recently founded, regional Software Craftsmanship
Communities in Germany.

[Remarks]
---------

That is why the theme for this year is "Innovate & Renovate: Evolving Testing".
Innovate: to introduce changes and new ideas
Renovate: to repair and improve something, restore to life
