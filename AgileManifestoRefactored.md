# The Agile Manifesto â€“ Refactored

Most of you know the infamous ["Manifesto for Agile Software Development"](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/):

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

The last paragraph is often overlooked which results in counterproductive chaos.
This might be related to the specific wording.
Recently, another wording occurred to me that _might_ be more intent-revealing and _might_ resolve some misunderstanding.
It is a little more focused on the _work_ in agile development.

We use processes and tools as long as they do not impede individuals and interactions
We provide comprehensive documentation as long as it does not impede working software
We do negotiate contracts as long as it does not impede customer collaboration
We follow a plan as long as it does not impede responding to change

What do you think?
